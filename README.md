# Hue Web Frontend

The aim of this project is to create a small, touch friendly web interface which
would allow you or a guest (basically, anyone with access to your local network)
to quickly control the Hue lights in your home from a phone or tablet.

Right now, what you get is a very simple UI that lists all your groups and allows you to toggle each group on or off, as well as set the brightness, saturation and hue.

**Getting Started**

- In the `src` folder, update the placeholder values in `default_config.js` and rename the file to `config.js`
- Run `npm start`

**Additional Notes**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find a detailed guide of available commands [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
