# Hue Web Frontend

The aim of this project is to create a small, touch friendly web interface which
would allow you or a guest (basically, anyone with access to your local network)
to quickly control the Hue lights in your home from a phone or tablet.

I will probably lose interest in this, like, tomorrow and never finish it, so don't hold your breath!

**Additional Notes**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find a detailed guide of available commands [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
